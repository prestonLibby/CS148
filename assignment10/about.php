<h2>My background</h2>

<p>
	I'm a computer science major at the University of Vermont. I've been building and tinkering on computers for years,
	and it's truly a passion of mine. I especially love custom builds, as they allow me to take part in creating something unique
	for someone that perfectly matches their needs (and budget!).
